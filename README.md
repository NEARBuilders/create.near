This project a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) app bootstrapped with [@near-js/client](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/tree/master/packages/client), [@tanstack/react-router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest), and [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). It uses [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for styling, [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components, and offers a [playwright suite](https://playwright.dev/) for testing.

To easily add more components, [browse the shadcn catalog](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button) and follow its installation guide. You can also easily generate themes through tools [like this one](https://zippystarter.com/tools/shadcn-ui-theme-generator), and copy and paste your colors into the [input.css](./src/input.css).

## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Building for production

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Running tests

```bash
pnpm run test
```

### Load shadcn component

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

See the full [testing guide](./playwright-tests/README.md).

## Learn more about NEAR

To learn more about NEAR, take a look at the following resources:

- [NEAR Developer Portal](https://dev.near.org/) - homebase for near developers.
- [NEAR Documentation](https://docs.near.org) - learn about NEAR.
- [Frontend Docs](https://docs.near.org/build/web3-apps/quickstart) - learn about this example.

You can check out [the NEAR repository](https://github.com/near) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Ethereum wallet login

If developing in testnet and logging in with an Ethereum wallet, you will need to top up the created EVM wallet on NEAR Testnet.
Go to [Aurora's NEAR wallet playground](https://near-wallet-playground.testnet.aurora.dev/), switch to the chain, connect to Metamask and load accounts, then Add funds.

Note that you should also modify the Project IDs in [ethereum-wallet](./src/wallets/ethereum-wallet.ts) for the REOWN_PROJECT_ID.

## Preparing for production

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```

## Deploy to web4

1. Build the project

```cmd
pnpm run build
```

2. Create a web4 subaccount of your master account (this will be your domain).

```cmd
near account create-account fund-myself web4.MASTER_ACCOUNT.testnet '1 NEAR' autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain sign-as MASTER_ACCOUNT.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send`
```

Be sure to "Store the access key in legacy keychain"!

3. Run web4-deploy to upload production bundle to nearfs and deploy it to a minimum-web4 contract to your account.

```cmd
npx github:vgrichina/web4-deploy dist web4.MASTER_ACCOUNT.testnet --deploy-contract --nearfs
```

Deploy shoudl be accessible and your website accessible at 

`testnet`: MASTER_ACCOUNT.testnet.page

`mainnet`: MASTER_ACCOUNT.near.page
